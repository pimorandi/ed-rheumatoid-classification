# Processed Data

This directory contains preprocessed data ready for model training. Files are generated by the `preprocess_data.py` script.

## Data Description

Each file is in JSONL format (JSON Lines), where each line represents a single patient record with the following fields:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `anon_id` | Anonymized patient identifier |
| `label` | Classification label (1 = rheumatoid symptoms, 0 = control) |
| `input_ids` | Token IDs of the tokenized input text |
| `token_type_ids` | Token type IDs for the model input |
| `attention_mask` | Attention mask for the tokenized sequence |

## Data Selection

The processed datasets include:
- **Class 1**: Patients with rheumatoid pathologies
- **Class 0**: Control patients selected through propensity score matching algorithm

This approach ensures balanced comparison groups by matching control patients to cases based on relevant covariates.

## Processing Pipeline

The `preprocess_data.py` script performs the following steps:
1. Takes raw data file as input
2. Applies propensity score-based selection for control records
3. Tokenizes clinical text using the specified tokenizer
4. Saves processed records in JSONL format

## Note on Data Privacy

Due to patient privacy regulations, processed data files are not included in this repository. Users with appropriate data access can generate these files using the preprocessing script.
